# Welcome to my first project!

My name is Austin Driggs and I am an Electrical Engineering student at WVU.
Please check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austindriggs/)!

### Purpose

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to display my "Now Playing" songs from Spotify onto an LED matrix panel, along with some added features.

The purpose of this project is to of course learn some new technical skills, but to also practice things related to my career in open sourced coding/projects and project management. I want to document everything along the way to cite sources from what I've learned, decisions I've made, and also to track time. 

## Important Information

### Project Epic

Please see the [Project Epic](https://github.com/austindriggs/spotify-led-matrix/issues/16) for a list of all issues and tasks completed and the order they were completed in.

### Hardware

The KiCAD project is for v7.

### Software

I plan to use python.
