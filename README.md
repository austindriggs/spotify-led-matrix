# Welcome to my first project!

My name is Austin Driggs and I am an Electrical Engineering student at WVU.

Please check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/austindriggs/)!

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to of course learn some new technical skills, but to also practice things related to my career in open sourced coding/projects and project management. I want to document everything along the way to cite sources from what I've learned, decisions I've made, and also to track time. 

### Important Information

#### KiCAD

The KiCAD project is for v7.
